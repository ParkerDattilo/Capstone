  Begin by installing python. Then, using pip, install the following libraries with the command 'pip install <command>' from the terminal where you will be running the python scripts:
   matplotlib
   mahotas
   scikit-image
   numpy
   pillow
   
   You also need to install the vimba sdk to access the camera. Make sure when going through the install to select the application development download. Follow the instructions to download the python sdk here https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/vimba-sdk/ . Don't forget to run the install from the command line as specified in the VimbaPython/Source directory after install. If you do not have write permission on the device in that directory, be sure to use the https://github.com/alliedvision/VimbaPython repository to install the sdk
